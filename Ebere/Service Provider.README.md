## Cloud Service Provider

A cloud service provider, or CSP, is a company that offers components of cloud computing -- typically, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS).

Cloud service providers use their own data centers and compute resources to host cloud computing-based infrastructure and platform services for customer organizations. Cloud services typically are priced using various pay-as-you-go subscription models. Customers are charged only for resources they consume, such as the amount of time a service is used or the storage capacity or virtual machines (VM) used. For SaaS products, cloud service providers may either host and deliver their own managed services to users or they can act as a third-party, hosting the application of an independent software vendor.

The most well-known cloud service platforms are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure.
