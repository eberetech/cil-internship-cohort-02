## SERVICE MODELS AND THEIR USED CASES
There are basically three types of service models, which include;
- Infrastructure as a Service(IAAS)
- Platform as a Service (PAAS)  
- Software as a Service (SAAS) 
# Infrastructure as a service (Iaas); 
IaaS is a way to deliver a cloud computing infrastructure like server, storage, network and operating system. One can access these resources over cloud computing platform.In IaaS, you buy complete resources rather than purchasing server, software, datacenter space or network equipment.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), are made of highly scalable and automated compute resources. IaaS is fully self-service for accessing and monitoring things like compute, networking, storage, and other services, and it allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as-needed instead of having to buy hardware outright.
- IaaS delivers Cloud Computing infrastructure to organizations, including servers, network, operating systems, and storage, through virtualization technology. These cloud servers are typically provided to the client through a dashboard or an API, and IaaS clients have complete control over the entire infrastructure. IaaS provides the same technologies and capabilities as a traditional data center without having to physically maintain or manage all of it. IaaS clients can still access their servers and storage directly, but it is all outsourced through a virtual data center in the cloud.IaaS clients are responsible for managing aspects such as applications, runtime, OSes, middleware, and data. However, providers of the IaaS manage the servers, hard drives, networking, virtualization, and storage. Some providers even offer more services outside of the virtualization layer, such as databases or message queuing. Some of the use cases of infrastructure as a service includes;
- Hosting Complex Websites- Infrastructure as a service is not always appropriate for simple websites, it can be the optimal basis for more complex web projects. Particularly for sites with profoundly fluctuating traffic. A website hosted in the cloud, for instance, can profit from the verbosity rendered by a massive network of physical servers and demand scalability to manage unanticipated demands.
- Program Testing and Development; Software firms can benefit considerably from the scalability of an IaaS solution. With just a small amount of work, the testing and development environments can be set up and scaled again.IaaS can be trusted to run critical business projects with higher scalability  and higher security.
- Big Data Analysis; One of the building blocks of modern marketing is collecting huge amounts of user data. Processing them is even more important than collecting this information. IaaS can manage, store and analyze big data because it can handle large workloads and can incorporate with business intelligence tools. This helps get business insights, with which users can build relations with their clients and predict current trends.
- High Computing Performance; Encountering complex tasks including several million variables or calculations usually entails the use of supercomputers or clusters. Here, Infrastructure as a service can be a better alternative because of its scalability.As the complexity of the networks always continues to grow, Infrastructure as a services are being considered for networking as support.

## Platform as a service (Paas);
PaaS is a programming platform for developers. This platform is generated for the programmers to create, test, run and manage the applications. A developer can easily write the application and deploy it directly into PaaS layer. Cloud platform services, or Platform as a Service (PaaS), provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. PaaS provides a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications. All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications. This form of cloud computing delivers development environments as a service. You build your own applications that run on the provider’s infrastructure and are delivered to your users via the Internet from the provider’s servers. Like Legos, these services are constrained by the vendor’s design and capabilities, so you don’t get complete freedom, but you do get predictability and pre-integration.PaaS's delivery model is similar to SaaS's, except that instead of delivering software over the internet, PaaS provides a platform for software development. This platform is offered through the web, allowing developers to focus on developing applications while without having to deal about operating systems, software updates, storage, or infrastructure.
PaaS enables enterprises to design and build apps that are integrated into the PaaS via unique software components. As they adopt cloud qualities, these applications, or middleware, become scalable and highly available. This common use case of platform as a service can be seen in;
- Application Intergration; Application integration is the process of enabling individual applications—each designed for its own specific purpose—to work with one another. By merging and optimizing data and workflows between multiple software applications, organizations can achieve integrations that modernize their infrastructures and support agile business operations. Application integration helps bridge the gap between existing on-premises systems and fast-evolving cloud-based enterprise applications. Through seamlessly interconnected processes and data exchanges, application integration allows enterprises to orchestrate a variety of functions across their entire infrastructures, enabling businesses to operate more effectively and efficiently.
- Data Intergration;  is a process where data from many sources goes to a single centralized location, which is often a data warehouse. The end location needs to be flexible enough to handle lots of different kinds of data at potentially large volumes. Data integration is deal for powering analytical use cases.It gives the runtime is a process where data from many sources goes to a single centralized location, which is often a data warehouse. The end location needs to be flexible enough to handle lots of different kinds of data at potentially large volumes.
- API Management; An API management platform is a tool used to access, distribute, control, and analyze APIs used by developers in an enterprise setting. API management platforms benefit organizations by centralizing control over their API integrations while ensuring they continuously meet high performance and security standards.
- Examples includes;
Oracle Cloud Platform
IBM Cloud Foundry
AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Red Hat OpenShift
AWS Lambda

## Software as a service (Saas);
- Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts and makes applications available to clients via the Internet. SaaS is one of three major cloud computing categories, along with infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) (PaaS). Strong performances by businesses such as Salesforce in the embryonic SaaS industry contributed to SaaS being a defining element of the modern economy.SaaS tightly offers business software to thousands of customers via what is known as multitenant architecture. The cloud component merely denotes an active internet connection as well as the devices and browsers that allow access. All of the elements that define software, such as scripts, codes, and algorithms, as well as the physical hardware in the form of servers and the structures that house them, are kept and maintained by the vendors in their own facilities, a significant reversal in how deployment is carried out, as stated earlier. On the customer side, there is no upfront investment in servers or software license; on the provider side, prices are reduced compared to traditional hosting because there is only one app to maintain.
- Software as a Service (SaaS) arose largely as a result of the rising understanding that the internet offers a viable alternative to on-premise installation, which has dominated computing since its beginnings. SaaS eliminates the requirement for businesses to install and run software on their own computers or in their own data centers, which normally necessitates a significant investment in infrastructure, logistics, and people. This removes the costs of purchasing, provisioning, and maintaining hardware, as well as software license, installation, and support. Software as a Service is the most commonly utilized option for businesses in the cloud market. SaaS uses the internet to deliver applications to its users, which are managed by a third-party vendor. Many SaaS applications are run directly through the web browser, making it unnecessary for clients to download or install the application. Some of the use case of software as a service can be found or utilized on CRM applications, Solution to Human Resource (HR),Pre-existing Billing & Invoicing systems
