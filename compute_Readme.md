## Cloud Computing
The cloud refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. Rather than keeping files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database.
They are basacilly two basic model working behind the serices making cloud computing feasible and they include
- deployment model
- service model
But i will be elaborating on service model and the different types of service model in cloud computing

## SERVICE MODEL
They are majorly three broad service categories which include;
- Infrastructure as a Service(IAAS)
- Platform as a Service (PAAS)  
- Software as a Service (SAAS) 
# Infrastructure as a service (Iaas); 
IaaS is a way to deliver a cloud computing infrastructure like server, storage, network and operating system. One can access these resources over cloud computing platform.In IaaS, you buy complete resources rather than purchasing server, software, datacenter space or network equipment.Some common examples include, Digital Ocean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE).

## Platform as a service (Paas);
PaaS is a programming platform for developers. This platform is generated for the programmers to create, test, run and manage the applications. A developer can easily write the application and deploy it directly into PaaS layer. It gives the runtime environment for application development and deployment tools.some common example includes, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, OpenShift.

## Software as a service (Saas);
SaaS is known as 'On-Demand Software'.It is a software distribution model. In this model, the applications are hosted by a cloud service provider and publicized to the customers over internet.In SaaS, associated data and software are hosted centrally on the cloud server.User can access SaaS by using a thin client through a web browser.CRM, Office Suite, Email, games, etc. are the software applications which are provided as a service through Internet which may include Salesforce (customer relationship management software), HubSpot (marketing software), Trello (workflow management), Slack (collaboration and messaging),Google Workspace, Dropbox, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting etc

- Other service models includes,storage as a service, communication as a service, network as a service and monitoring as a service.
